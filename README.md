Code written to analyse photoelectrochemical data

This folder contains several files with functions to analyse:
Cyclic voltammetry (CV_analysis.py),
Chronoamperometry (Photocurrents.py),
Stepped chronoamperometry (Stepped_chronoamperometry.py),
UV-vis spectroscopy (uvvis.py)

As well as a file for all graphing functions (Graphing.py)

Use the Dataoutput.py file to run code as it will keep everything clean!
You can find some examples of code to run there.
